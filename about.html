    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="seashell-background rounded">In college, Elizabeth worked for several nonprofits including Students For Liberty
      and Young Americans For Liberty, organizing conferences and on campus events with hundreds
      of attendees and overseeing the blog team as the blogging content manager for SFL as part
      of the North American Executive Board.</h4>
      <br>
      <h4 class="seashell-background rounded">Since graduating from Kansas State University in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science
        degree in Political Science, Elizabeth went on to complete formal paralegal certification at
        the Center For Advanced Legal Studies studying litigation, corporate and family law. During and after
        the completion of the CALS program, Elizabeth worked for several years as a corporate immigration paralegal in Santa Clara, CA,
        juggling an average of 250 PERM cases for several large silicon valley tech clients along with various other greencard and NIV matters.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="seashell-background rounded">In doing so, Elizabeth acquired over a decade of experience in delivering exceptional customer service
        and balancing competing demands with aplomb. While working in immigration law, she discovered a love
        for programming including front end development and design; a love that continues to this day whenever she finds herself with time to spare.
        In December 2017, Elizabeth moved to San Francisco to join Pearl Law Group as a Case Coordinator. She's enjoying adventuring and excited to see what
      the next ten years will bring.  </h4>
